### Main Page, Navigation, and Footer
The main page is where you will find the two types of roasts that Stave Coffee currently has. The two pictures are clickable links that take you to the respective product pages.The Nav bar at the top is rendered on all pages and includes links to the Blog, Our Founders, Peru, Guatemala, Sign Up, and Sign In pages. The footer also renders on all pages and has the name of the company, the slogan, and an icon that takes you off website to Stave Coffee's instagram page. 

### Blog
The blog is the section of the app with full CRUD functionality. This page is restricted to users with accounts only. You must sign up and then log in to view this page. This is where the user would post a blog about any topic they want (hopefully Stave Coffee related). This page lets the user edit or delete blog posts that only belong to them.
